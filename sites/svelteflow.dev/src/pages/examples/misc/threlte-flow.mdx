<ExampleLayout>
You may have noticed that the hero flow on our [our homepage](/) is actually written in React ðŸ™ˆ.
For all the non-believers, here it is written in Svelte Flow with help from the [amazing Threlte library](https://threlte.xyz/).

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="examples/misc/hero-flow"
  dependencies={{
    '@threlte/core': 'latest',
  }}
  tailwind
/>

</ExampleLayout>

<UnusedPropWarning />

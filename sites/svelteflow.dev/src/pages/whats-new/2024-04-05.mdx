# The Future of Svelte Flow

While we have been hard at work on React Flow v12, listening to your feedback and bug reports and Svelte 5 slowly peeking over the horizon, we wanted to share some of our plans for the library.

## Aligning some internals

We redesigned a lot of the internal update logic in React Flow v12 and we wanted to bring some of that to Svelte Flow. As both libraries already share a substantial core, extending it to include this last missing piece will improve maintainability a lot.
We are planning to release this bigger update in the next weeks alongside a couple of other improvements.

## Svelte 5

While most announcements surrounding the upcoming Svelte version have stirred a lot of mixed reactions, we are actually quite excited about it! A lot of the new features will simplifying our lifes as library maintainers (looking at you fallback values for props). Because we want to keep the library as svelty as possible, this will include some breaking changes. However, we don't want all of your amazing projects you already built to break, so this will mark a major version bump for Svelte Flow, namely âœ¨<b>1.0.0</b>âœ¨.

You can expect some bugfixes for 0.x.x, but it being a pre-release version we will move on to Svelte 5 as our main focus.

## New features

After this transition we will be able to develop new features for React & Svelte Flow in tandem, so keep your eyes peeled for some exciting new stuff coming your way!

Thanks everyone who has been supporting the development so far by trying everything out and getting their hands dirty! We are looking forward to the future of Svelte Flow! ðŸš€

# Migrate to v12

Before you can use the [new features](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/discussions/3764) that come with React Flow v12 like server side rendering, computing flows, and dark mode, here are the breaking changes you'll have to address first.

### 1. A new npm package name

The package `reactflow` has been renamed to `@xyflow/react` and it's not a default import anymore.

#### Old API

```js
// npm install reactflow
import ReactFlow from 'reactflow';
```

#### New API

```js
// npm install @xyflow/react
import { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';

// you also need to adjust the style import
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';

// or if you just want basic styles
import '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';
```

### 2. Node attribute “computed”

All computed node values are now stored in `node.computed`. Besides the new package name, this is the biggest change. After React Flow measures your nodes, it writes the dimesions to `node.computed.width` and `node.computed.height`.

#### Old API

```js
// getting the measured width and height
const nodeWidth = node.width;
const nodeHeight = node.height;
```

#### New API

```js
// getting the measured width and height
const nodeWidth = node.computed.width;
const nodeHeight = node.computed.height;
```

### 3. Updating nodes and edges

We are not supporting node and edge updates with object mutations anymore. If you want to update a certain attribute, you need to create a new node / edge.

#### Old API

```js
setNodes((currentNodes) =>
  currentNodes.map((node) => {
    node.hidden = true;
    return node;
  }),
);
```

#### New API

```js
setNodes((currentNodes) =>
  currentNodes.map((node) => ({
    ...node,
    hidden: true,
  })),
);
```

### 4. Custom node props

We renamed the `posX` and `posY` props to `positionAbsoluteX` and `positionAbsoluteY`

#### Old API

```js
function CustomNode({ posX, posY }) {
  ...
}
```

#### New API

```js
function CustomNode({ positionAbsoluteX, positionAbsoluteY }) {
  ...
}
```

### 5. `getNodesBounds` options

The type of the second param changed from `nodeOrigin` to `options.nodeOrigin` / `options.useRelativePosition`

#### Old API

```js
const bounds = getNodesBounds(nodes: Node[], nodeOrigin)
```

#### New API

```js
const bounds = getNodesBounds(nodes: Node[], { nodeOrigin })
```

### 6. Typescript changes for defining nodes and edges

We simplified types and fixed issues about functions where users could pass a NodeData generic. The new way is to define your own node type with a union of all your nodes. With this change, you can now have multiple node types with different data structures and always be able to distinguish by checking the `node.type` attribute.

#### New API

```js
type NumberNode = Node<{ value: number }, 'number'>;
type TextNode = Node<{ text: string }, 'text'>;
type AppNode = NumberNode | TextNode;
```

You can then use the `AppNode` type as the following:

```js
const nodes: AppNode[] = [
  { id: '1', type: 'number', data: { value: 1 }, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } },
  { id: '2', type: 'text', data: { text: 'Hello' }, position: { x: 200, y: 200 } },
];
```

```js
const onNodesChange: onNodesChange<AppNode> = useCallback((changes) => setNodes(nds => applyChanges(changes, nds)), []);
```

You can read more about this in the [Typescript guide](/learn/advanced-use/typescript).

### 7. Rename `nodeInternals`

If you are using `nodeInternals` you need to rename it to `nodeLookup`.

#### Old API

```js
const node = useStore((s) => s.nodeInternals.get(id));
```

#### New API

```js
const node = useStore((s) => s.nodeLookup.get(id));
```

### 8. Removal of deprecated functions

We removed the following deprecated functions:

- `getTransformForBounds` (replaced by `getViewportForBounds`)
- `getRectOfNodes` (replaced by `getNodesBounds`)
- `project` (replaced by `screenToFlowPosition`)
- `getMarkerEndId`

### 9. Custom `applyNodeChanges` and `applyEdgeChanges``

If you wrote your own function for applying changes, you need to handle the new "replace" event. We removed the "reset" event and added a "replace" event that replaces specific nodes or edges.

### That's it!

We hope you like v12! To see a full breakdown of what's new in this version, you can read about it [here](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/discussions/3764).

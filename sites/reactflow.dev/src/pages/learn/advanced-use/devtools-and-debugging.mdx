# Devtools and Debugging

<Callout type="info">
  This is an ongoing experiment on implementing React Flow devtools. While we
  are working on the actual package, we would be happy to hear about your
  feedback and ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Bqt6xrs) or via mail at
  info@xyflow.com.

React Flow might sometimes seem like a magic black box, but in reality you can reveal its secrets quite easily! Say goodbye to nasty `console.log` all over your code and use our current implementation as a copy pastable solution today.
From our own experience developing new features, we constantly end up logging the same values like nodes and changes. Our proposal for the React Flow devtools is an independent component you can pass to your flow to get a better understanding of what is happening under the hood.

The current implementation consists of three toggable components: `ChangeLogger`, `NodeInspector` and the `ViewportLogger`:

<div className="nestedSandpack">
  <ExampleViewer
    codePath="api-flows/Devtools"
    options={{
      editorHeight: 500,
      editorWidthPercentage: 45,
      wrapContent: true,
    }}
    additionalFiles={[
      'Devtools.tsx',
      'ChangeLogger.tsx',
      'NodeInspector.tsx',
      'ViewportLogger.tsx',
      'style.css',
    ]}
    isTypescript
    editorHeight={400}
    sandpackOptions={{
      classes: {
        'sp-wrapper': 'lel',
      },
    }}
  />
</div>

If you want to try out our current approach, you can copy paste all or parts of the code above into your project. The components are independent and can be used separately. The `Devtools` component is the main component that wraps the other components. It also provides buttons to toggle the visibility of the different features.

## Node Inspector

If you want to get some insights about your node attributes, you can use the `NodeInspector` component. As you can see the implementation is pretty straight forward. It uses [`useNodes`](/api-reference/hooks/use-nodes) to get the current nodes and the [`ViewportPortal`](/api-reference/components/viewport-portal) to render the node attributes in a separate container without the need to apply the current viewport transform. You can add more attributes to the `NodeInspector` component by adding them to the `NodeInfo` component.

## Change Logger

If you are working with a controlled flow, React Flow calls `onNodesChange` with changes that the user need to apply in order to keep the state in sync. The `ChangeLogger` component logs these changes. The implementation is quite sneaky, because it intercepts the users `onNodesChanges` function. For this we get the user provided `onNodesChange` function from the store, extend it and call it after we added the actual changes to our changes list.

## Viewport Logger

This is the simplest component of the three. It logs the current viewport position and zoom level in a [`Panel` component](/api-reference/componentns/panel).

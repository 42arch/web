# OnNodesChange

If you opt for using a controlled flow, you gain the advantage of handling any changes to the nodes yourself, however this means that React Flow will not apply any of these changes for you. Making a mistake here can lead to unexpected behavior. You are behind the wheel now.

```tsx
export type OnNodesChange<NodeType extends Node = Node> = (
  changes: NodeChange<NodeType>[],
) => void;

export type NodeChange<NodeType extends Node = Node> =
  | NodeDimensionChange
  | NodePositionChange
  | NodeSelectionChange
  | NodeRemoveChange
  | NodeAddChange<NodeType>
  | NodeReplaceChange<NodeType>;
```

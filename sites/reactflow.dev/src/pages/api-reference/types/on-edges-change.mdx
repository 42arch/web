# OnEdgesChange

If you opt for using a controlled flow, you gain the advantage of handling any changes to the edges yourself, however this means that React Flow will not apply any of these changes for you. Making a mistake here can lead to unexpected behavior. You are behind the wheel now.

```tsx
export type OnEdgesChange<EdgeType extends Edge = Edge> = (
  changes: EdgeChange<EdgeType>[],
) => void;

export type EdgeChange<EdgeType extends Edge = Edge> =
  | EdgeSelectionChange
  | EdgeRemoveChange
  | EdgeAddChange<EdgeType>
  | EdgeReplaceChange<EdgeType>;
```

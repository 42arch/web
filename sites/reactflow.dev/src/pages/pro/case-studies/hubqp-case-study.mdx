<QandA
  className="mt-16"
  question="Can you briefly describe Hubql?"
  answer="Hubql is a collaboration platform for building and visualizing data schemas together.
"
/>

<QandA
  question="What problem or decision were you facing that made you decide to use React
  Flow?"
  answer="We were seeking a React library that helps us to turn data models into visualization without spending too much time building abstractions and interactive elements. To save time in development we opted for a stable, mature and feature-rich library that we can extend with custom rendering options.
"
/>

<QandA
  question="How are you currently using React Flow?"
  answer="We use React Flow to transform data models such as in JSON or Prisma into visualization as diagrams or graphs. Data model AST is passed to React Flow to generate nodes and edges based on data relationships which are rendered with custom nodes in table-like UI for easier understanding."
/>

<QandA
  question="Can you give an example of something about React Flow that you have found
  especially useful?"
  answer="Mainly the events to control drag, click behaviours of nodes are very useful to extend functionality as well as the rendering of custom nodes gives very high flexibility in the user interface for rich user experience and branding."
/>

<QandA
  question="Have you experienced any issues or challenges while using the library? If so,
  how were they resolved?"
  answer="We have actually not faced any issues other than performance problems from our side that could be solved by optimizing our React code. React Flow itself is very stable and gives great performance out of the box.
"
/>

<QandA
  question="How have the features of your React Flow subscription helped you so far?"
  answer="It enabled us to quickly add more file support for our product giving the ability to pass a standardized structure of nodes and edges with flexible rendering. As a result we can add additional file types to visualize in just about a day thanks to the abstraction available to render any data structure."

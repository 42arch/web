We've been doing this React Flow thing for a good few years now. Not only has a
lot of the library's development been driven by our own real-world experience,
we've also been fortunate enough to receive a lot of really great feedback from
the community too. This feedback often comes in the form of GitHub issues and
discussions in our Discord server, but we also conducted a survey of some of our
Pro subscribers back in 2022.

Getting this sort of feedback is invaluable: our users come from all sorts of
backgrounds and our library is used by big companies and individuals alike. We
decided quite late in the year to run an end-of-year survey to both discover
and celebrate what the community has been up to with React Flow, but also to
uncover the current pain points in both the library and our documentation.

Now 2024 is getting away from us, and it's time to share what we found! This report
serves two purposes:

1. To share the results of the survey with the community! In particular we think
   it's great to celebrate all the different people and projects that are using
   React Flow.

2. To help other open source projects understand what sort of insights they might
   be able to gain from running a survey of their own.

If you just care about the results, we also have a fun interactive React Flow app
that shows off the highlights [here]().

## Our method

Any good survey starts with a clear goal in mind, and while none of us are
researchers, we did our best to make sure that we were asking the right questions
in the right way. We put together a survey using Typeform
([did you know they use React Flow?](https://www.typeform.com/help/a/use-the-logic-map-to-add-logic-to-your-forms-5514792640916/))
that would help us learn about our community in five important areas:

1. **Who our users are and what is their expertise.** We know our users come from
   all sorts of backgrounds and we're often discussing how to make sure our content
   serves everyone (that's how we ended up with our super quick [TypeScript primer](https://reactflow.dev/api-reference#a-note-for-javascript-users)
   for JavaScript users). Getting a better understanding of who our users are means
   we can rely less on our gut feeling and make sure we're tailoring our content
   to the right people.

2. **What they are building with React Flow.** We love seeing all the cool things
   people are building with React Flow! We wanted to know what sort of projects
   people are working on to see if there were any unexpected use cases that we
   could learn from or what common types of apps we could focus our development
   and documentation efforts on.

3. **Where our users go to get help.** We spend a lot of time on our documentation
   so it's important to know that time is being spent in the right places. We have
   analyticis to tell us what pages are popular, but if folks are heading somewhere
   else to get help then that can tell us something too!

4. **What features or things do they find most difficult about React Flow** and
   **what would they like to see added.** Gathering feature requests is a no-brainer
   for a survey like this â€“ especially as we wrap up work on React Flow v12 and
   set our sights on the future. But it's also useful to learn about the pain points
   folks run into when using the library, especially if we can factor in their
   different backgrounds and use cases.

5. **What our users think about React Flow Pro**, why they would or would not
   subscribe, and what they think about the pricing. It can feel a little uncomfortable
   to talk about money in an open source project, but our Pro subscribers keep the
   lights on and make sure we can can keep working on the project. That being said,
   it's important to us that our regular users (that make up the vast majority of
   our community) don't feel like we're squeezing them for cash or holding features
   hostage. This vibe check can tell us if we're communicating what React Flow Pro
   is about effectively.

It's easy to fall into the trap of asking questions and collecting data that you
don't need. Working out the gender split of React Flow users might be interesting,
but "because it's interesting" is not a compelling reason for research! Keeping
these goals in mind helps us focus the questions and make sure we're collecting
information we can make use of.

There's always a balance between wanting to capture the most information possible
and making sure that the survey is short enough that people will actually take
some time to fill it out. We designed the majority of the survey questions to be
multiple choice (with many optionally including a free-form "other" response) and
left the most important questions open-ended.

## What we found

The survey ended up being 19 questions long, and took a little less than 10
minutes to complete. We had a total of 86 responses and worked out we had a 42.2%
completition rate: that means about 200 people started the survey and roughly 120
of them didn't finish it. A completition rate of 42% is actually pretty good for a
survey like this!

### Who is using React Flow?

We mentioned in the previous section that discovering things like the gender
split of our community weren't important to us, so what sort of information
_did_ we collect?

- 57% new to React Flow. Folks new to the library/community might be more engaged
  and willing to provide feedback.

- Half respondands _didn't_ put frontend as an area of expertise. That perspective
  is important when we consider our documentation and how we communicate with our
  users.

- We had some respondants from data science and design backgrounds: not even
  developers!

- Majority of respondants said they were using React Flow _at work_. This is
  interesting given that most of the respondants _also_ said they were new to
  the library and/or frontend development.

### What are people building with React Flow?

- We were surprised to see the number of whiteboard or infinite-canvas style
  apps users were building with React Flow. This has got us thinking about what
  examples we can provide to help support this kind of use case.

- We were also surprised to see how much _internal_ tooling was being built the
  library. Often internal tools can be a bit unglamerous, but this turned out to
  be one of the largest categories! The features we've added for computing flows
  in React Flow v12 should help these folks a lot.

- Yawn ai / workflow builder / no-code someone please write something insightful
  about these things.

### How do our users get help when they're stuck?

- A surprising _26%_ of folks said they were getting help with React Flow from
  ChatGPT. This is a little disheartening given the amount of time we spend on
  our docs, but it's made us consider whether we can offer something similar
  directly. We have _so much_ documentation now that something more conversational
  might be the best way to navigate it!

- On the other hand, 90% of respondants said they were using the official
  documentation! Hooray. More interestingly, **8** people said they _don't_ use
  the docs: for those folks our _discord_ server reigns supreme. Maybe there is
  something to be said for a more conversational approach to our docs ðŸ‘€

- We forgot to put GitHub as an option for this question, but still got 6 responses
  listing it. In our experience quite a few people _do_ open issues and discussions
  to get help, so what gives? We ran an "event" on Discord that linked to the survey
  and added a banner to our documentation site â€“ folks visiting these places would
  have _known_ we were running a survey. On the other hand there was no way to
  know that the survey was being run from GitHub: if you primarily used GitHub to
  get support or interact with the team then you likely would have never known we
  were running a survey.

- Our documentation is split up into three categories: API reference, examples,
  and guides/tutorials. We asked participants if there is a category of docs that
  they use more than others and 48% said they use the API reference the most! On
  the other hand, only 15% said they use the tutorials the most, and the examples
  sit somewhere in the middle. When we compare this to how much time participants
  have spent with the library, it is clear the newcomers spend more time with our
  long-form guides and more-experienced folks want to jump right into the API
  reference.

### What are the biggest pain points using React Flow?

### How do our users feel about React Flow Pro?

## Tips for other maintainers

- Make sure you're reaching your entire community! We fumbled the bag by not
  making it clear to our GitHub-based users that we were running a survey and
  we've missed out on some valuable feedback!

- Keep the survey short and focused. The attrition rate for these sorts of surveys
  is high and only gets higher the longer the survey is or the more detail you
  ask participants to provide.

For the last few months we‚Äôve been wrapping up a solid v12 release for y‚Äôall. Since v11, we‚Äôve grown our core team to five people, reached nearly 20k stars on github, rebranded to xyflow, launched Svelte Flow (many great side-effects of this are baked into this release), and kept all of our office plants alive.

This release also brings the final piece of the ‚Äúxyflow‚Äù puzzle, as our package name changes from `ReactFlow` to `@xyflow/react`. We pinky promise that we won‚Äôt change our package name again anytime soon!

This has been in beta since January and we‚Äôve been tending to bugs since then, so we‚Äôre confident in sending this out now as a stable release. Shout-out to the brave souls who have already tried it out and submitted your issues, we appreciate you! üôèüèª

(If you want to skip the details and just migrate from 11 to 12 ASAP, use our [migration guide](https://reactflow.dev/learn/troubleshooting/migrate-to-12) )

Let‚Äôs dive into v12! üåä

## TL;DR

React Flow v12 is here, and the main features are

- Support for Server Side Rendering
- Hooks and helpers for computing flows
- Built-in dark mode
- Better DX via TSDoc

# What‚Äôs new here?

## 1. Support for server side rendering

[SHOW AN EXAMPLE HERE]

React is heading towards server side rendering, with tools like [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [waku](https://waku.gg/). We‚Äôve gotten asked to do server side rendering more than a [couple](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/issues/3168) of [times](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/issues/3384) due to difficulties using React Flow with these tools. In v11, Astro just renders a React Flow diagram as blank by default- that‚Äôs no good.

With v12, you can now:

- Display static HTML diagrams for docs sites (even if client has no JS)
- Dynamically generate opengraph images that appear as embeds when sharing a link to your flow
- Pre-render flows for crawlable content

## 2. Computing flows - hooks and helpers

[show an example here]

One of the most difficult things about using React Flow is state management, even though it‚Äôs really a general difficulty with React.

In v12 We added helpers to simplify getting data from connected nodes, updating node data, and managing the data between nodes. It‚Äôs nothing like fully-fledged state management libraries like Zustand, but maybe this can help folks who just need to do some simple data processing on the client-side to get up-and-running faster with their React Flow apps.

## 3. Built-in dark mode

(Example with dark stuff)

We added a `colorMode` prop, where you can toggle between "light", "dark", or "system". Under the hood, React Flow just adds a class name to the wrapper, but we had to do a bunch of changes to make this possible. Now all of the default styles are using CSS variables, so you can easily build your own themes based on that.

(add link to dark mode docs, if they exist)

## 4. Better Dev Experience with TSDoc

We used TSDoc to create a better dev experience in your IDE to get more info about what a function or component does. We‚Äôve been told our DX is pretty good already üíÖüèª we‚Äôre always happy to make it even better.

Bonus content

**Performance:** Ivan! Thanks for this. Some of the most beautiful pull requests we‚Äôve ever seen. Improved performance by changing the default of nodeDragThreshold from 0 to 1, so that the function isn‚Äôt called every time you click a node, but only when it‚Äôs moved. SMART. (link to pull requests, or some visual change?)

# Even more features!

Besides the new main features listed above, we added some other things that we wanted to include for a long time.

- **`[useConnection` hook](/api-reference/hooks/use-connection):** With this hook you can access the ongoing connection. For example, you can use it for colorizing handles styling a custom connection line based on the current start / end handles.
- **Controlled `viewport`:** This is an advanced feature. Possible use cases are to animate the viewport or round the transform for lower res screens for example. This features brings two new props: `[viewport](/api-reference/react-flow#viewport)` and `[onViewportChange](/api-reference/react-flow#on-viewport-change)`.
- **`[ViewportPortal](/api-reference/components/viewport-portal)` component:** This makes it possible to render elements in the viewport without the need to implement a custom node.
- **`[onDelete](/api-reference/react-flow#on-delete)` handler**: We added a combined handler for `onDeleteNodes` and `onDeleteEdges` to make it easier to react to deletions.
- **`[onBeforeDelete](/api-reference/react-flow#on-before-delete)` handler**: With this handler you can prevent/ manage deletions.
- **`[isValidConnection](/api-reference/react-flow#is-valid-connection)` prop:** This makes it possible to implement one validation function for all connections. It also gets called for programmatically added edges.
- **Background component**: add `[patternClassName](/api-reference/components/background#pattern-class-name)` prop to be able to style the background pattern by using a class name. This is useful if you want to style the background pattern with Tailwind for example.
- **`onMove` callback** gets triggered for library-invoked viewport updates (like fitView or zoom-in)
- **`deleteElements`** now returns deleted nodes and deleted edges
- add **`origin` attribute** for nodes
- add **`selectable` attribute** for edges
- Correct types for `BezierEdge`, `StepEdge`, `SmoothStepEdge` and `StraightEdge` components
- New edges created by the library only have `sourceHandle` and `targetHandle` attributes when those attributes are set. (We used to pass `sourceHandle: null` and `targetHandle: null`)
- Edges do not mount/unmount when their z-index change
- `nodeDragThreshold` is 1 by default instead of 0

And that‚Äôs it for v12, thanks for sticking around and using React Flow üåª

See you around!
